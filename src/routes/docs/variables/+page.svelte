<p class="text-lg mt-6">
	Variables are a fundemental part of any programming language, and mine is no
	different. In this chapter, you will learn how to create, mutate, and use
	variables. In Zelv lang varialbe types are inferred, so you do not need to
	define a type. Strings are defined by wrapping the value in quotes, and
	numbers are defined by simply writing the number. You can also use variables
	in expressions, such as <code>let myVar = 10 + 5</code>, which will create a
	variable called <code>myVar</code> with the value of <code>15 </code>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold py-3">Creating Variables</h2>

<p class="text-lg">
	To create a variable, you use the <code>let</code> command, followed by the
	name of the variable, and then the value you wish to assign to it. For
	example, to create a variable called <code>myVar</code> with the value of
	<code>10</code>, you would write:
	<br />
	<code>let myVar = 10</code>
	<br />
	This will create a variable called <code>myVar</code> with the value of
	<code>10</code>.
	<br />
	If you wish to create a variable with a string value, you can do so by wrapping
	the value in quotes. For example, to create a variable called
	<code>myString</code> with the value of <code>"Hello, World "</code>, you
	would write:
	<br />
	<code>let myString = "Hello, World"</code>
	<br />
	This will create a variable called <code>myString</code> with the value of
	<code>"Hello, World"</code>.
